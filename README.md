# Malaria-cell-Detection-using-CNN
In Malaria cell Detection i am going to use the Convolutional Neural Network along with the Web page on Streamlit
Overview
This project aims to classify malaria-infected cells from uninfected cells using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). Malaria is a life-threatening disease caused by parasites transmitted to people through the bites of infected female Anopheles mosquitoes. Early and accurate detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project leverages deep learning to automate the detection process, improving accuracy and efficiency.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Cell Images for Malaria Detection. It consists of 27,558 images of blood smears, with equal instances of parasitized and uninfected cells.

Installation
To get started with the project, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies which i write i requirement.txt 

Results
The trained CNN model achieved the following performance metrics on the test set:

Accuracy: 96%
Precision: 95%
Recall: 97%
F1 Score: 96%
